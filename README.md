# **Problem Solving Practice** 


### **Goal**

 * I am dedicating this repository to keep track of my practice with Algorithms and Data Structures.
 * I will dedicate one branch (one project in Eclipse) to each concept(algorithm or DS), in which you will find the related problems
   I solved, then I wil merge it to the master.
 
 * Nice comments will be inlined to explain the approach and confusy parts to help me next time I revisit
   the same problem.
   
 * URLs to choosen videos or even articles explaining the approach, helped me to understand.
 
 * Each problem in a separate class named briefly as the problem's  name, and some test cases will be provided.
 
 #### **Active Branches**
