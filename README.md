# **Problem Solving Practice** 


### **Goal**

 * I am dedicating this repository to keep track of my practice with Algorithms and Data Structures.
 * I will dedicate one branch to each concept(algorithm or DS), in which will find the related problems
   I solved.
 
 * Nice comments will be inlined to explain the approach and confusy part to help me next time I revisit
   the same problem.
   
 * URLs to choosen videos or even articles explaining the approach, helped me to understand.
 
 * Each problem in a separate class named briefly as the problem's  name, and some test cases will be provided.
 
 
 
 
 > **Note:** Hopefully this going to be helpful to anybody else.
