 * https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version
 * problem definition :
 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. 
 * Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. 
 * Since each version is developed based on the previous version, 
 * all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one,
 * which causes all the following ones to be bad.
 * Example:
 * Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.
 * call isBadVersion(3) -> false
 * call isBadVersion(5) -> true
 * call isBadVersion(4) -> true
 * Then 4 is the first bad version.
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. 
 * Implement a function to find the first bad version. 
 * You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

	/*
	 * It's straightforward we can binary search the series of versions until we find the
	 * first bad version
	 * this time since it's mentioned in the problem definition "you should minmize the number of calls to the API"
	 * so, we will use abit different implementation of regular binary search to reduce the
	 * number of calls to isBadVersion.
	 * Essentially that can be acheived by making the condition of loop(left < right)
	 * instead of  (left <= right) and return left after the loop, to lower the number of iteration
	 * this is abit tricky and you need to dry-run it with the numbers or even run your debugger to
	 * see what's going on
